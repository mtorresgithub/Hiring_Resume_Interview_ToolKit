# Hiring_Resume_Interview_ToolKit
Transitioning Veteran, Federal, and General Hiring Best Practices and resources

This is a community resource. I am not the author of some of these resources. This is a a personal collection of resources, FAQs, best practices, and tips I've come across over the years. This solely serves as informational examples -- neither its original authors or I provide any guarantees of employment. We hold no liability for its use or outcomes as a result of its use.  

The best practices in this toolkit solely reflect my opinions and should be treated as informational. I encourage you to contact a professional recruiter or a career coach for guidance and expert advice.

Resume & Letter writing is stylistic, and there are many correct and incorrect ways to prepare your resume, communicate with potential employers, and prepare your hiring package. Use these resources at your discretion. Feel free to use them freely, edit them as necessary, and share them as needed.

- Cover Letter and Interview Thank you Email Resources
